## ⭐️ Efficient Deployment and Debugging of a Fine-Tuned Language Model Classifier Using Python SDK & Cloud Tools by Samira Korani
(45 mins) In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, deploying and debugging fine-tuned language models (LLMs) efficiently in cloud environments has become a critical skill for developers and researchers. This talk delves into the practical aspects of deploying a fine-tuned LLM classifier using Python Software Development Kit (SDK) in a cloud-based setting. We begin by exploring the fundamentals of LLMs, emphasizing the significance of fine-tuning these models to achieve enhanced performance in specific tasks. The core of the talk focuses on the deployment process. We discuss the integration of Python SDK with popular cloud platforms, providing a step-by-step guide on preparing the environment, deploying the fine-tuned LLM, and ensuring seamless integration with cloud resources. Emphasis is placed on the scalability and efficiency of deployment, catering to the needs of high-traffic applications.A significant portion of the presentation is dedicated to debugging strategies in the cloud. We address common challenges encountered during the deployment of LLM classifiers, such as performance bottlenecks, model inconsistency, and resource management issues. Practical solutions and best practices for monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting are presented, utilizing the capabilities of Python SDK and cloud tools

This session introduces the benefits of python in cybersecurity and how you can use python to solve cyber challenges.

## ABOUT SPEAKER
### 🙂 SAMIRA KORANI

I have been working in the Computer Science field since 2013, working on natural language processing, and machine learning problems. Before choosing the computer science field for my career, as a young woman in an ideological country like Iran, my mind was full of philosophical questions. I tried to find myself and answer my primary enigma, “Living my life, my way.” I started my journey among people, places, songs, movies, dances, sports, and languages. I need that journey, and I believe everybody needs the journey. Finally found my way into tech. I designed and developed many AI-based software, After a while, I have decided to get back to academia. I am doing PhD at NUIG.
